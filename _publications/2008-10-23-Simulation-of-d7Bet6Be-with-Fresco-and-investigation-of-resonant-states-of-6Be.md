An ongoing study is presented into the resonant states of 6Be via simulation of d(7Be,t)6Be with Fresco to investigate the results of "Searching for resonances in the unbound 6Be nucleus" a paper by K.Y. Chae. In this paper the d(7Be,t)6Be reaction was studied to search for resonances in the 6Be nucleus that may be used to increase our knowledge of the 3He(3He,2p)4He reaction. A 100-MeV 7Be beam from the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) was used to bombard CD2 targets, and tritons were detected by the Silicon Detector Array (SIDAR). It was concluded that a combination of reaction mechanisms are necessary to account for the observed triton energy spectrum. This will be further investigated by simulating the various reaction mechanisms with Fresco to try to reproduce and explain these results.
