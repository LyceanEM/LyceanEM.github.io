STEM for Britain 2023
--------------------------------
STEM for BRITAIN is a major scientific poster competition and exhibition which has been held in Parliament since 1997, and is organised by the Parliamentary & Scientific Committee. Chaired by Stephen Metcalfe MP, its aim is to give members of both Houses of Parliament an insight into the outstanding research work being undertaken in UK universities by early-career researchers.

I was delighted to be a finalist with my poster on Open Source Electromagnetics for Giga Scale Antenna Arrays using LyceanEM.
