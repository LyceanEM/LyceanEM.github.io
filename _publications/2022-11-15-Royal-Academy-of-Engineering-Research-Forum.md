Outline
-------
Combining computer vision, efficient electromagnetics modelling and radio channel
measurements to provide a consistent understanding of the local environment for enhanced
energy efficiency, reliability and security in future intelligent networks. This is one of my primary research themes, together with interests in next generation
antenna array design, radar systems, and open source electromagnetics models (LyceanEM).
