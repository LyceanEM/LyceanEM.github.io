This paper presents a link performance study for mmWave systems at 60 GHz. The study is based on mmWave wireless modem measurements. The system performance is characterized by means of common metrics such as packet delivery rate, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and throughput. The effect of spatial and polarisation diversity/multiplexing is explored, considering various modulation and coding schemes (MCS). Based on our findings, spatial diversity mostly impacts the quasi/non-Line-of-Sight (LoS) locations, whereas the gain from polarization diversity is more significant for horizontal polarized transmitters. Finally, results are compared to results from a channel measurements campaigns, performed at the University of Bristol at the same time, showing similar SNR trends, and thus empowering the validity of our results.
