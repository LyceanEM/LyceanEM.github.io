excerpt: 'Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data has become a stable of modern life, whether delivered through a
smartphone, vehicle, or as part of an industrial dataset. The expectation of reliable position and time information,
irrespective of the environment, becomes challenging in tunnels and canyons with significant multipath, whether
natural or urban.
An initial look at an open dataset of LIDAR, Computer Vision, and GNSS data is presented, combined with a channel
model produced from this dataset, comparing the expected and measured line of sight and multipath contributions
from GPS sources while moving around Bristol, from unobstructed surroundings to deep natural and urban canyons.'
