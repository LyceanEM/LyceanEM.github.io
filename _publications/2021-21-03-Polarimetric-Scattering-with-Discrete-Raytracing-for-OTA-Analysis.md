The use of millimetre waves (mmWave) requires the development of novel,
robust over the air (OTA) test methods. One low-cost OTA method is based
upon an elliptical arrangement of reflectors, to allow conformance testing
of devices at mmWave. A discrete ray model is used to predict the influence
of reflector shape and arrangement on scattering at 24GHz for two reference
surfaces of differing size and a substrate reflector. The model shows a
correlation of 0.99 between the predicted and measured scattering for the
larger reference surface, and root mean square (RMS) error of -69dB, while
for the smaller reference surface the model achieved a correlation of 0.98
between the predicted and measured scattering, and an RMS error of -69dB.
