excerpt: 'Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data has become a stable of modern life, whether delivered through a
smartphone, vehicle, or as part of an industrial dataset. The expectation of reliable position and time information,
irrespective of the environment, becomes challenging in tunnels and canyons with significant multipath, whether
natural or urban.
An initial look at an open dataset of LIDAR, Computer Vision, and GNSS data is presented, combined with a channel
model produced from this dataset, comparing the expected and measured line of sight and multipath contributions
from GPS sources while moving around Bristol, from unobstructed surroundings to deep natural and urban canyons.'

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data has become a stable of modern life, whether delivered through a smartphone, vehicle, or as part of an industrial dataset. The expectation of reliable position and time information, irrespective of the environment, becomes challenging in tunnels and canyons with significant multipath, whether natural or urban. An open dataset of Lidar, Computer Vision, Inertial measurement, and GNSS data is presented, combined with preliminary analysis of the dataset on a selected recording, considering GPS coarse acquisition, lidar and computer vision based navigation together with model based channel reconstruction. Lidar and video based techniques demonstrate positioning error as low as 3.8m root mean square error, together with GNSS acquisition and signal blockage alignment with computer vision and lidar maps.
