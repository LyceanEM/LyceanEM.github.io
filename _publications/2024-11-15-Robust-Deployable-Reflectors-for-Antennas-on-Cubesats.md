excerpt: 'A deployable corner reflector antenna for an 8U CubeSat operating at 1.5 GHz is proposed. The impact of reflector size, position, and opening angle is analysed using simulations for a monopole feed antenna. A fixed (non-deployable) prototype mounted on a 8U CubeSat chassis was found to improve the directivity from 3.7 dBi to 8.6 dBi when the reflectors were included, with good agreement between the simulated and measured radiation patterns.

A deployable corner reflector antenna for an 8U CubeSat operating at 1.5 GHz is proposed. The impact of reflector size, position, and opening angle is analysed using simulations for a monopole feed antenna. A fixed (non-deployable) prototype mounted on a 8U CubeSat chassis was found to improve the directivity from 3.7 dBi to 8.6 dBi when the reflectors were included, with good agreement between the simulated and measured radiation patterns.
