Fifth generation (5G) networks will utilise the large bandwidth available in millimetre wave (mmWave) frequency bands up to 100 GHz in order to meet the ever-increasing high data rate demands. Efficient communications system design for such networks requires a thorough understanding of the propagation properties of the electromagnetic signals at such high frequencies. This paper presents the results of a polarimetric channel measurement campaign at 26 GHz and 60 GHz showing that diffuse scattering can be a dominant propagation mechanism for mmWave links. The use of a wide bandwidth provides a detailed insight into the multipath structure of the channel. It is shown that in a diffuse scattering scenario, nearly co-incident signals create small scale fading that affects the flatness of the channel significantly even when directional antennas are used. This also results in large co-to-cross polarisation ratio (XPR) variations across the channel bandwidth.
