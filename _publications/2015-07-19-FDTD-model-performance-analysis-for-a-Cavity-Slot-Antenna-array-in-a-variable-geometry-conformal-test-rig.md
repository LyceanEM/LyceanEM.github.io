In the pursuit of cost effective conformal antenna array design, an efficient and fast Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) model is a highly desirable tool. This paper evaluates the performance of the University of Bristol Electrical Engineering Departments FDTD Model. The model is used to predict the antenna array patterns and inter element coupling for a variety of different antenna arrays in a variable geometry conformal antenna array test rig. A performance analysis and a comparison of measurements using the test rig with predictions using FDTD modelling is presented for the Cavity Slot Antenna Element.
