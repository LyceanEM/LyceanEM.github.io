A comparison of Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods, for conformal antenna array modelling. This study includes the measurement of Dual Feed Dual Circular Patch Antenna elements mounted in the Variable Geometry Conformal Antenna Array Test Rig. These measurements together with predictions from the Bristol FDTD Model, allows a comparison of antenna array measurements with model predictions over a range of conformal curvatures, with an aim to reducing technical risks in conformal antenna array design.
