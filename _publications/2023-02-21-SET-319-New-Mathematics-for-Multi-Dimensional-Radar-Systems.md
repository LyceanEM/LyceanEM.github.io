Outline
---
The  development  of  the  networked  battlespace  as  a  concept,  and  the wealth  of  wired  and  wireless communications to support it have opened the door to truly multidimensional radar systems. Whether as a static network of radars coordinating to provide national coverage, or a local network for UAVâ€™s providing a  swarm  aperturefor  rapidly  reconfigurable  airborne  radar,  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  a  flexible  radar channel  model  to  empower  the  engineer  and  scientist  to  develop  new  systems,  sensing  algorithms  and concepts of operation. LyceanEM, an open source electromagnetics model is presented as a solution to this issue, allowing for multi source, heterogeneous antenna arrays to be simulated together with a radar target, and the effects of timing jitter to be explored within the demonstrator system.
