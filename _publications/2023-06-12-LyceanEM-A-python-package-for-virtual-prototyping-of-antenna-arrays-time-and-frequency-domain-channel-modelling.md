The design of antenna arrays to meet complex requirements in sensors and communications depends upon access to robust tools to access and prototype potential antenna arrays on their intended structures without the need for in depth antenna design. Together with the simulation of wider communications and imaging problems, there is a pressing need for efficient electromagnetics tools capable of scaling from individual antennas to ultra large scale antenna arrays with 1000s of individual antenna elements.
