excerpt: 'The electromagnetic environment represents a consistently open RF attack surface. Spatial fingerprinting is proposed
as a fusion of spatial intelligence, onboard electromagnetic modelling and machine learning to allow nodes within a
network to identify and localise transmitters in their locality . This capability forms the basis of reciprocal trust
networks between nodes in a node work, enabling self securing behaviour, and the identification and localisation of
unauthorised transmitters attempting to penetrate the network. This process is demonstrated using modelled and
measured data of LoRa network packets with an Anechoic Chamber, allowing for complete modelling of the scattering
environment within the spatial intelligence node, and localisation of the transmitters.'
