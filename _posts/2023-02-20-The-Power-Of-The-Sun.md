I'm excited to announce "The Power of the Sun : Workshop on Space Based Solar Power", funded by the University of Bristol, and supported by the Satellite Applications Catapult and Virtus Solis. Beyond the academic interest in the problems of modelling such large antenna arrays in orbit, I am very excited about the possibility of transforming what was a staple of science fiction, into a very real contributor to the energy mix.

The Power of the Sun : Workshop on Space Based Solar Power
-------------------------------------------------------------
Space Based Solar Power represents an attractive source of clean and sustainable energy, which could form part of the UK Net Zero commitment. However, to make the transition from concept to implementation, there are a number of important challenges which need to be addressed. 

This workshop on will allow the international community, developing a diverse range of concepts, to network and discuss attractive new technologies, and potential areas of collaboration. One of the key areas of collaboration is the formation of a working group on data standardisation for space based solar power, consisting of data interchange standards for antenna array design, array element patterns, wireless power transfer, and standards for digital twins of these ultra large scale energy systems. This workshop is supported by the University of Bristol, the Satellite Applications Catapult, and Virtus Solis and represents an opportunity to bring together cutting edge research in areas such as photovoltaics, Concentrated Solar thermal Power technologies, ultra large scale structures, and wireless power beaming in one event.

The workshop will be held on the 4th of May 2023 in Bristol, UK

This workshop is aimed at academics, industry reps (both support companies and space based solar power groups), and policymakers. It will allow the international community, developing a diverse range of concepts, to network and discuss attractive new technologies, and potential areas of collaboration.
