What's the point of Modelling?

---

When a system is being designed that involves some complicated and expensive components, there is an ever present risk that the sub-systems will not fulfil the design specifications. This is difficult enough for experiments and prototypes, but for large scale projects this can represent significant risk to the overarching project, and increased development costs to the tune of millions.

In order to mitigate this, any competent engineer will seek to model the proposed system, to ensure that it will be capable of the demanded performance.
