Announcement of Royal Academy of Engineering Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Fellowship.

---

I am delighted to announce the start of my Royal Academy of Engineering IC Postdoctoral Fellowship for my research **Spatial Fingerprinting for self-securing Wireless networks**.

Secure wireless communications are critical to the modern world, and with increasing data traffic their security and privacy only becomes more important. This research combines conventional sensing and direction-finding techniques with machine learning and radio frequency fingerprinting to develop methods for self-securing networks of trusted devices.
