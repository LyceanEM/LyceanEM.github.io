Workshop Announcement: RF Sensing as a Service
A workshop hosted by the University of Bristol as part of my research into satellite based passive radar, in order to explore the challenges, breakthroughs and applications for space based sensor networks.

If you are interested in Earth Observation or Radar please sign up to this University of Bristol led event funded by [SPRINT- SPace Research and Innovation Network for Technology]( https://www.sprint.ac.uk/). The workshop, aims to bring together academic, industry and government stakeholders to explore challenges, breakthroughs and applications for space based sensor networks. The workshop will present the SPRINT funded feasibility study 'Passive Satellite Radar for Maritime Applications', a collaborative project between myself at the University of Bristol, Wai-keung Fund at the Cardiff Metropolitan University, 4 Earth Intelligence and Polychord Ltd.

I am very excited about this research, and if you are interested in attending this workshop, you can find the link to register your interest [here]( https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/rf-sensing-as-a-service-space-based-sensor-networks-for-passive-radar-tickets-383496417107)
