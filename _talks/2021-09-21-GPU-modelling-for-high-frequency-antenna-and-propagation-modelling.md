As mobile communications expands to higher frequency domains, the development of accurate, cost effective methods of antenna array design and over the air (OTA) validation is required to ensure that user equipment is capable of meeting the system requirements of beamformed directivity and pointing accuracy. In the course of developing these methods, GPU enhanced modelling allows for accurate simulation of the scenarios under test and exploration of different system configurations
