As GPU capabilities allow for more detailed electromagnetics and physical models to be explored on smaller platforms, there is an opportunity for overlap between ways of measuring the 3D space, and the measurement architecture itself. The use of different sensing modes for Digital Twins allows for the possibility of radio frequency measurements with accompanying computer vision or lidar measurements, in order to allow the researcher to account for the signature of the built environment, office space, or anechoic chamber within the measurement. Initial work will be presented, and the concept explored for future work.
