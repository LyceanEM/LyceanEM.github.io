This course is designed to give an understanding of the issues involved in the design and evaluation of equipment that must comply with electromagnetic compatibility standards. Covering the circuits and structures which give rise to interference, and the mechanisms by which this occurs. Calculating the crosstalk between different conductors, while introducing the different methods of screening and grounding to mitigate this interference.
