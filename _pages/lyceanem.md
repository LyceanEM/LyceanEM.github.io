{% include base_path %} [LyceanEM](https://lyceanem-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python library for modelling electromagnetic propagation for sensors and communications. Frequency Domain and Time Domain models are included that allow the user to model a wide array of complex problems from antenna array architecture and assess beamforming algorithm performance to channel modelling. The model is built upon a ray tracing approach, allowing for efficient modelling of large, low density spaces.

`LyceanEM` is designed with collaborative research in mind and is under continuous development. While initially developed for rapid virtual prototyping of antenna arrays on complex platforms, `LyceanEM` is has now demonstrated multiple additional use cases. The primary application is as a flexible channel model, with Frequency and Time domain modes, with examples in publication or due for publication in Communications, and Satellite Based Passive Radar.

`LyceanEM` is also designed to generate training data for machine learning approaches to sensors and communications. The current generation is based around static scenes for scattering and antenna and array design, but a new release is planned for December 2022 with support for more sophisticated raycasting, multi-material propagation, and prediction of doppler effects for complex scattering.

`LyceanEM` has extensive documentation, with examples of the major functions, and the documentation will be continusly updateded with the library. The documentation, along with examples and instructions for installation can be found [here](https://lyceanem-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
