Sensing, Communicating, and Effecting our environment with microwaves. Using novel electromagnetics models to support the development of antenna arrays within the context of the overall system requirements. While radar, RF sensors, and communications systems all have divergent and often conflicting needs, the same principles are at play in transmission, propagation and sensing.

Validating such complex models remains a key issue for development, but by merging different sensing methods such as LIDAR or computer vision, the ground truth can be established for a series of measurements. This combination of optical and radio sensing offers opportunities to accelerate timetables both in the laboratory, and in a systems design environment. 

Seeing the future in a truly lycean way.
