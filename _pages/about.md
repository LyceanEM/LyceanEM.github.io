Sensing, Communicating, and Effecting our environment with microwaves. Using new electromagnetics models to support the development of new planar and conformal antenna arrays to interact with our environment in new ways, making us safer, healthier, and better informed with radar and communications technology.

Seeing the future in a truly lycean way.
